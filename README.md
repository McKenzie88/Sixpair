# Sixpair

This application can pair a PS3 Sixaxis controller to your iOS device using your Mac.

This project uses `MobileDevice.framework` to grab the bluetooth address of a connected iOS device, and program it into a connected Sixaxis controller using `IOKit.framework`.

The project in its current state is a raw code dump from a while ago, and is in severe need of refactoring/updating.

It is being released in time for an update of Matthias Ringwald's [Blutrol](http://www.icontrolpad.com/blutrol/), which allows you to use your PS3 controller to play games on your iOS device.
